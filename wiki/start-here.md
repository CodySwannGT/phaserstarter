# Start here — Collector — Game Docs Wiki

## Purpose
The durable knowledge base and source of documentation for the Collector Phaser 4 starter — architecture, conventions, design decisions, and playbooks. This wiki is the canonical reference; the README is a thin pointer. Keep it current as the game evolves.

## What this is
A git-native LLM Wiki owned by **Collector** and maintained by the `lisa-wiki` kernel. It is the
durable home for this project's knowledge (and documentation). Raw sources are preserved under
`wiki/sources/`; distilled knowledge lives in the category pages; the rules are in
`wiki/schema/llm-wiki-contract.md`.

## How to use it
- **New here?** Run `/onboard-me` (Codex: `$lisa-wiki-onboard-me`) for a guided tour + sample questions.
- **Find/answer something:** `/query "<question>"` — cited answers from the wiki.
- **Add knowledge:** `/ingest <url|file|prompt>` (Codex: `$lisa-wiki-ingest`), or `/ingest` with no
  argument for a full ingest across all enabled non-external-write sources (external-write sources
  require explicit intent).
- **Browse:** [index.md](index.md).
- **Check health:** `/lint`.

## Map
